Swift’s **`Task`** struct lets us start running some work immediately, and optionally wait for the result to be returned. And it is optional: sometimes you don’t care about the result of the task, or sometimes the task automatically updates some external value when it completes, so you can just use them as “fire and forget” operations if you need to. This makes them a great way to run async code from a synchronous function.   


First, let’s look at an example where we create two tasks back to back, then wait for them both to complete. This will fetch data from two different URLs, decode them into two different structs, then print a summary of the results, all to simulate a user starting up a game – what are the latest news updates, and what are the current highest scores?

Here’s how that looks:
