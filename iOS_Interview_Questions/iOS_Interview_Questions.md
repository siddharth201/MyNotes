## iOS Basics

### Q. Can you explain the iOS Application Lifecycle?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The iOS app lifecycle is managed by the UIApplication object. The main states are:  

**(NIABS)**

**1. Not Running:** App is not launched or has been terminated.

**2. Inactive:** App is running but not receiving events (e.g., incoming call).

**3. Active:** App is running in the foreground and receiving user input.

**4. Background:** App is running code in the background but not visible to the user.

**5. Suspended:** App is in memory but not executing code, ready to be resumed quickly.  

### Callbacks in AppDelegate:

• `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` → called when the app launches.

• `applicationDidBecomeActive(_:)` → app enters foreground.

• `applicationWillResignActive(_:)` → app will move to inactive state.

• `applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)` → app moved to background.

• `applicationWillEnterForeground(_:)` → app is about to become active again.

• `applicationWillTerminate(_:)` → app is about to be killed.

### Q. Can you explain the UIViewController lifecycle.
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A UIViewController manages a screen in an iOS app. The lifecycle methods are:

`1. init(coder:) / init(nibName:bundle:)` → initialization of controller.

`2. loadView()` → loads the main view (used rarely, mostly overridden when creating views programmatically).

`3. viewDidLoad()` → called once when the view is loaded into memory (best place to set up UI, API calls).

`4. viewWillAppear(_:)` → called before the view appears on screen (update UI, analytics).

`5. viewDidAppear(_:)` → called when view is visible (start animations, video, etc.).

`6. viewWillDisappear(_:)` → called before leaving the screen (save data, stop animations).

`7. viewDidDisappear(_:)` → called when the view has gone offscreen (clean-up tasks).

`8. deinit` → called when the view controller is deallocated (release resources).

### Q. What is the difference between CFBundleVersion and CFBundleShortVersionString?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>  

**CFBundleShortVersionString**  

• This is the “marketing version” of your app.

• Usually shown to users in the App Store or app settings.

• Format: "Major.Minor.Patch" (e.g., "1.2.3")

• Purpose: Communicate the app version to users.

**Example in Info.plist:**

```
<key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
<string>1.2.3</string>
```

---

**CFBundleVersion**

• This is the “build number” of your app.

• Represents a specific build for internal tracking or deployment.

• Can be any string (usually integer increments: "1", "2", "3").

• Purpose: Track specific builds for testing, CI/CD, or App Store uploads.

**Example in Info.plist:**

```
<key>CFBundleVersion</key>
<string>45</string>
```
</details>  


## **Swift Programming Language**  

### **Q. What is the difference between var and let in Swift?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>  

In Swift, we use `var` and `let` to store values in memory.
But the difference comes in how we can change those values later.
  
  
**var = Variable (Changeable value)**

• If you use **var**, the value can be changed later.

**Example:**

```
var name = "Anand"
name = "Rahul"   // Allowed
```

**let = Constant (Fixed value)**

• If you use **let**, the value cannot be changed once it’s assigned.

**Example:**

```
let pi = 3.14159
pi = 3.14   // Error: Cannot change a constant
```

This makes your code **safe** because you know the value won’t change accidentally.

**When to use var:**

* Use it when the value is expected to change in the future.
* Example:

  * User’s current location
  * A counter in a loop
  * A score in a game

**When to use let:**

* Use it when the value should stay the same.
* Example:

  * Birthdate of a person
  * API keys
</details>  

### **Q. What are the common data types in Swift?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> 

**1. Int →** Whole numbers (10, -5)

**2. Double →** Decimal numbers with precision (3.14, -0.99)

**3. Float →** Decimal with less precision than Double

**4. String →** Text values ("Hello")

**5. Bool →** true or false

**6. Character →** Single letter ("A")

**7. Array →** Ordered list ([1,2,3])

**8. Dictionary →** Key-value pairs (["name": "Anand"])

**9. Set →** Unique unordered values ({1,2,3})

Swift is **type-safe →** Once a variable is declared with a type, you can’t assign a different type.
</details>  


### **Q3: What are optionals in Swift and why do we need them?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>  

• In Swift, a variable **must always have a value**.  
• But sometimes, a value may be missing (like data from an API or database).  
• To handle this, Swift uses **Optionals**.

**Optional means:** The variable can hold a value OR **nil**.

**Example:**

```
var name: String? = "Anand"
name = nil   // allowed because it's optional
```

**Why is it needed?**

* Avoids null pointer errors (common in other languages).
* Makes code safer by forcing you to check before using.

**Ways to use Optionals:**

**1. Forced Unwrapping (!)**

```
let value: String? = "Hello"
print(value!)   // "Hello", but crash if nil
```

Use only if you are sure it’s not nil.

**2. Nil Coalescing (??)**

```
let username = name ?? "Guest"
```

If the name is nil, it will use "Guest".

**3. Optional Binding (if let / guard let)**

```
if let value = value {
    print(value)   // safe
}
```

### **Q: What are closures in Swift?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> 

• A closure is a **block of code** that you can store in a variable, pass as an argument, and call later.  
• Think of it as a **function without a name (anonymous function).**

**Example:**

```
let greet = { (name: String) -> String in
    return "Hello, \(name)"
}

print(greet("Anand"))   // "Hello, Anand"
```

**Closures are used for:**

1. Callbacks (e.g., when a button is clicked)
2. Passing code as a function parameter
3. Asynchronous tasks like API completion handlers
4. Higher-Order Functions like map, filter, reduce  
</details>

### **Q: What are Higher Order Functions in Swift?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>  

• A **Higher Order Function (HOF)** is a function that either:

* Takes another function as a parameter
* Returns a function as its result
* (Or it can do both!)

These functions make code **shorter, cleaner, and easier to read**.

Swift gives us some very commonly used HOFs to work with collections like **Array**:

**1. map → Transform each element**

```
let numbers = [1,2,3]
let squared = numbers.map { $0 * $0 }   // [1,4,9]
```

Use case: When you want to convert or transform each item in an array.

**2. filter → filters elements based on a condition**

```
let even = numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }   // [2]
```

Use case: When you want to keep only certain items based on a condition.

**3. reduce → combines all values into one**

```
let sum = numbers.reduce(0) { $0 + $1 }   // 6
```

Use case: When you want to add, multiply, or combine all values into a single result.

**4. compactMap → removes nil values while transforming**

```
let numbers = ["1", "2", "three", "4"]
let validNumbers = numbers.compactMap { Int($0) }
print(validNumbers)   // [1,2,4]
```

Use case: When converting data that may fail (like String → Int).

**5. forEach → loop over elements in a cleaner way**

```
let names = ["Anand", "Rahul", "Neha"]
names.forEach { print("Hello, \($0)") }
```

Use case: Simple iteration with cleaner syntax than for-in.

**Why use Higher Order Functions?**

* Make code shorter and cleaner
* Avoid writing long for loops
* Easy to understand once you know them
* Very useful in functional programming style

### **Q: What are Extensions in Swift?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>   

• An extension in Swift is a way to **add new functionality** to an existing class, struct, enum, or protocol.  
• You can extend both your own types and system types (like String, Int, etc.).

**Why Use Extensions?**

* To add extra features without modifying original source code.
* To keep your code organized and readable.

**What You Can Do with Extensions**

* Add new computed properties
* Add new methods (instance methods, type methods)
* Add initializers
* Add subscripts
* Make a type conform to a protocol

But remember: You **cannot add stored properties** in an extension.

**Example:**

```
extension String {
    var isPalindrome: Bool {
        return self == String(self.reversed())
    }
}
```

```
print("level".isPalindrome)   // true
print("swift".isPalindrome)   // false
```

Here, we added a new property **isPalindrome** to String.

**Benefits of Extensions**

* Keep code clean and modular
* Add functionality to system types
* Helps in protocol-oriented programming
</details>

### **Q: What are Protocols in Swift?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>   

• A protocol is like a **blueprint** in Swift.  
• It defines a set of **methods, properties, or requirements** that a class, struct, or enum must follow if it adopts the protocol.

**Why Protocols?**

* To make sure different types follow the same rules
* To achieve abstraction (focus on what a type can do, not how it does it)
* To enable polymorphism

**Declaring a Protocol:**

```
protocol Drivable {
    func startEngine()
    func drive()
}
```

**Adopting a Protocol:**

```
class Car: Drivable {
    func startEngine() {
        print("Car engine started")
    }

    func drive() {
        print("Car is driving")
    }
}

let myCar = Car()
myCar.startEngine()
myCar.drive()
```
</details>

### **Q: What are Generics in Swift and Why are They Useful?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> 

• Generics allow you to write **flexible, reusable code**.  
• Instead of writing separate functions for Int, String, Double, etc., you write **one generic function**.

**Basic Example without Generics**

```
func swapInts(_ a: inout Int, _ b: inout Int) {
    let temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
}

func swapStrings(_ a: inout String, _ b: inout String) {
    let temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
}
```

You end up writing duplicate code for every type.

**Generic Solution**

```
func swapValues<T>(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T) {
    let temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
}
```

```
var x = 10
var y = 20
swapValues(&x, &y)

var str1 = "Hello"
var str2 = "World"
swapValues(&str1, &str2)
```

**T** is a placeholder type that works for any type.

**Why Generics are Useful**

* Avoids code duplication
* Makes code flexible
* Improves readability and maintainability
* Ensures type safety

**Use Case**

* Networking libraries use generics to return different models.

**Example: One generic API function to decode JSON**

```
func decodeJSON<T: Decodable>(_ data: Data, as type: T.Type) -> T? {
    let decoder = JSONDecoder()
    return try? decoder.decode(T.self, from: data)
}
```

**Benefits of Generics**

* Write less code → avoid repetition
* Reusable → works across many types
* Type-safe → errors caught at compile time
* Powerful → used everywhere in Swift (Arrays, Dictionaries, Combine, SwiftUI)
