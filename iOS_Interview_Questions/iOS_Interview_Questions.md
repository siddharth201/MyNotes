## iOS Basics

### Q. Can you explain the iOS Application Lifecycle?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The iOS app lifecycle is managed by the UIApplication object. The main states are:  

**(NIABS)**

**1. Not Running:** App is not launched or has been terminated.

**2. Inactive:** App is running but not receiving events (e.g., incoming call).

**3. Active:** App is running in the foreground and receiving user input.

**4. Background:** App is running code in the background but not visible to the user.

**5. Suspended:** App is in memory but not executing code, ready to be resumed quickly.  

### Callbacks in AppDelegate:

• `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` → called when the app launches.

• `applicationDidBecomeActive(_:)` → app enters foreground.

• `applicationWillResignActive(_:)` → app will move to inactive state.

• `applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)` → app moved to background.

• `applicationWillEnterForeground(_:)` → app is about to become active again.

• `applicationWillTerminate(_:)` → app is about to be killed.

### Q. Can you explain the UIViewController lifecycle.

<summary>Answer</summary>
A UIViewController manages a screen in an iOS app. The lifecycle methods are:

`1. init(coder:) / init(nibName:bundle:)` → initialization of controller.

`2. loadView()` → loads the main view (used rarely, mostly overridden when creating views programmatically).

`3. viewDidLoad()` → called once when the view is loaded into memory (best place to set up UI, API calls).

`4. viewWillAppear(_:)` → called before the view appears on screen (update UI, analytics).

`5. viewDidAppear(_:)` → called when view is visible (start animations, video, etc.).

`6. viewWillDisappear(_:)` → called before leaving the screen (save data, stop animations).

`7. viewDidDisappear(_:)` → called when the view has gone offscreen (clean-up tasks).

`8. deinit` → called when the view controller is deallocated (release resources).
